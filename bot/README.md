```

## Usage

### Commands

- `/connections` - Post a prompt to play today's Connections game
- `!connections` - Same as above (message command for testing)

### Automatic Posting

The bot automatically checks for completed games every 30 seconds and posts results to:
1. A channel named "connections" (if it exists)
2. Or the first available text channel

### Result Format

When a player completes the game, the bot posts:
- Player's username and avatar
- Colored emoji grid showing their guesses
- Score (categories solved)
- Mistakes made
- "Play now!" button to launch the Activity

## Configuration

You can customize the bot by modifying `bot.js`:

- **Polling interval**: Change `30000` (30 seconds) in `setInterval(checkForCompletedGames, 30000)`
- **Channel selection**: Modify the channel finding logic in `checkForCompletedGames()`
- **Embed colors**: Adjust the colors in the `EmbedBuilder` calls

## Notes

- The bot requires the MySQL database to be configured (same as the server)
- Results are only posted once per player per day
- The bot tracks posted games in memory, so restarting will re-post recent games
